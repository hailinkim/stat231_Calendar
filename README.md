# stat231_Calendar

Collected and wrangled the data exported from Google Calendar app using R dplyr and lubridate package to create data visualizations and track how my
time was spent. Answered three research questions:
1. How much do I procrastinate?--difference in time I have for studying and the actual time I spend on it.
2. How does my sleep schedule affect productivity?
3. How much time do I spend on cooking and eating meals? Does spending time on cooking affect my studying time?
